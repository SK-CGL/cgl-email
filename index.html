    body: `Respected Sir,
DoPT advised SSC to set the CGL 2025 age reckoning date as 01.01.2025, but it remains 01.08.2025. Last attempt candidates like us are losing out as Tier 1 nears. Please allow a short urgent meeting for our appeal before the exam.`
  },
  {
    subject: "Humble Appeal for CGL 2025 Age Reckoning Meeting",
    body: `Dear Sir,
Despite DoPT's clear recommendation for 01.01.2025, CGL 2025 still uses 01.08.2025 as age cutoff. This is excluding thousands of last attempt aspirants. We humbly request an immediate meeting before Tier 1 starts.`
  },
  {
    subject: "URGENT: Meeting on CGL 2025 Age Cut-Off",
    body: `Respected Chairman,
DoPT recommended 1 Jan 2025 as age date, but SSC has kept 1 Aug 2025. Many last attempt candidates are being excluded unjustly. Kindly grant us a brief meeting before Tier 1 for our representation.`
  },
  {
    subject: "Please Allow Meeting â€“ CGL 2025 Age Issue Not Fixed",
    body: `Respected Sir,
SSC has not acted on DoPTâ€™s advice to set 01.01.2025 as the age reckoning date for CGL 2025, and last attempt candidates are suffering. We urgently request a short in-person meeting before Tier 1.`
  },
  {
    subject: "CGL 2025 â€“ Urgent Meeting Request on Age Reckoning",
    body: `Dear Sir,
The CGL 2025 age cutoff remains 01.08.2025 instead of the recommended 01.01.2025. Last attempt aspirants are being unfairly denied their chance. Please permit a brief meeting before the exam.`
  },
  {
    subject: "Immediate Meeting Needed: CGL 2025 Age Cutoff",
    body: `Respected Sir,
DoPTâ€™s letter supported 01.01.2025 as age date. SSC has not revised the cutoff, and Tier 1 is days away. Please grant us a short urgent meeting to present the case.`
  },
  {
    subject: "Urgent CGL 2025 Meeting â€“ Age Reckoning Unresolved",
    body: `Dear Chairman,
Though DoPT recommended 01.01.2025 for CGL 2025, the cutoff remains 01.08.2025, costing last attempt candidates their chances. We request a short meeting ahead of Tier 1.`
  },
  {
    subject: "Humble Request: CGL 2025 Age Cut-off Meeting",
    body: `Respected Sir,
CGL 2025's unchanged age cutoff of 01.08.2025 is unfair after DoPT's 01.01.2025 advice. Please let us present our concern personally in a brief meeting before Tier 1 begins.`
  },
  {
    subject: "SOS Meeting: CGL 2025 Age Date Still Unresolved",

Despite DoPTâ€™s support for 1 Jan, CGL 2025's age reckoning remains 1 Aug. Last attempt candidates stand disqualified. We seek a short urgent meeting before Tier 1 to appeal.`
  },
  {
    subject: "Kindly Grant Meeting â€“ CGL 2025 Age Reckoning",
    body: `Respected Sir,
The age cutoff (01.08.2025) is yet to be updated to the DoPT-backed date of 01.01.2025 for CGL 2025. Last attempt candidates need your kind intervention through a meeting.`

DoPT directed 01.01.2025 for age reckoning but SSC has not changed from 01.08.2025. Please allow a brief meeting for affected last attempt aspirants before Tier 1.`

    subject: "Need for Meeting: Unchanged CGL 2025 Age Reckoning",

CGL 2025 retains 01.08.2025 for age reckoning, despite DoPTâ€™s 01.01.2025 advice. Last attempt aspirants lose their rightful chance. Please grant us a short meeting before Tier 1.`

  {
    subject: "SSC CGL 2025 â€“ Final Attempt Aspirantsâ€™ Meeting Appeal",

CGL 2025 age cutoff stands uncorrected at 1 Aug. Despite DoPT recommending 1 Jan, many are losing their last opportunity. Kindly permit a meeting before the exam.`
  },
  {
    subject: "Age Reckoning for CGL 2025 Unresolved â€“ Need Meeting",

    body: `Respected Sir,
Unchanged age reckoning date for CGL 2025 (01.08.2025 vs DoPTâ€™s 01.01.2025) is excluding last attempt candidates. Kindly meet us for urgent representation.`
  },
  {
    subject: "Final Request â€“ CGL 2025 Age Reckoning Update",

We respectfully request a short meeting before Tier 1 as the age cutoff remains 1 Aug 2025, despite DoPTâ€™s support for 1 Jan. Our last chance is slipping.`

DoPTâ€™s advice on 01.01.2025 age reckoning is unheeded in CGL 2025â€™s notification. Many candidates lose their last attempt. Please grant a brief meeting soon.`

With Tier 1 near, unchanged age cutoff of 01.08.2025 is excluding last attempt aspirants, against DoPTâ€™s recommendation for 01.01.2025. Please allow an urgent short meeting.`
