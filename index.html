    body: `Respected Sir,
We, the aggrieved last attempt candidates of SSC CGL 2025, humbly request you to kindly grant us an urgent meeting regarding the unresolved age reckoning issue.
As you are aware, the DoPT issued a letter on 1 July 2025 recommending that SSC consider revising the age reckoning date to 01.01.2025 for CGL 2025 and Phase 13. No action has been taken yet. In the DoPT office meeting you said there was no time to change it, but now with Tier 1 rescheduled to the first week of September, you have time to act.
Despite our continuous efforts, including filing RTIs and multiple follow-up emails, SSC has not responded to our concerns. We urgently seek a few minutes of your time today to present the matter in person before itâ€™s too late.`

    subject: "Humble Request for Short Meeting Today â€“ CGL 2025 Age Reckoning (01.01.2025) Relief",
    body: `Dear Sir,
This is a sincere appeal from last attempt SSC CGL aspirants who are severely impacted by the current age reckoning date of 01.08.2025 in CGL 2025.
We had earlier met you, and you kindly assured us SSC would act if DoPT sends a recommendation. DoPT fulfilled that on 1 July, yet the age reckoning remains unchanged. Earlier you mentioned shortage of time, but with Tier 1 now in the first week of September, the change is possible.
We request a brief meeting today to explain our situation and submit documents in person on urgent humanitarian grounds.`

    subject: "URGENT: Meeting Request Today â€“ CGL 2025 Age Reckoning Date (01.01.2025) for Last Attempt Candidates",
    body: `Respected Chairman Sir,
We respectfully seek an urgent meeting today before the commencement of SSC CGL 2025 Tier 1 in the first week of September. We are last attempt candidates, and despite DoPTâ€™s letter to SSC dated 01.07.2025, the age reckoning date remains unrevised to 01.01.2025. You had said there was no time to change it, but now the rescheduling gives that time.
The issue is causing widespread distress. Your intervention is our last hope. It will take only a few minutes to present our case.`

We are reaching out with folded hands to request an urgent meeting regarding the non-implementation of age reckoning as 01.01.2025 in SSC CGL 2025.
Despite DoPTâ€™s direction on 1 July 2025 and your previous assurance to us, SSC has not revised the reckoning date. You had earlier said there was no time, but now with Tier 1 in the first week of September, there is time to act.
Please grant us a short meeting to present supporting documents and our appeal in person.`

This is a humble request for a short meeting from a group of last attempt SSC CGL aspirants, who are deeply impacted by the unaddressed age reckoning issue in CGL 2025.
You had earlier assured us that SSC would act on a DoPT recommendation. That letter was issued on 1 July 2025, yet no change has been made. You previously said there was no time, but with the exam now in the first week of September, there is time.
Kindly allow us a few minutes today to discuss this in person.`

    body: `Respected Sir,
We are a group of last attempt SSC CGL aspirants requesting your kind intervention in the unresolved issue of age reckoning for CGL 2025.
The DoPT's letter dated 01.07.2025 clearly advised SSC to take appropriate action. However, no relief has been given to the affected aspirants. You had said earlier there was no time, but now with Tier 1 in September, there is enough time.
Please grant us an urgent meeting today to present our concern and documents.`

This is a final appeal for a meeting from last attempt SSC CGL candidates. The age reckoning issue remains unresolved even after the DoPTâ€™s formal communication to SSC on 01.07.2025.
With the exam now in September, you have the time to implement the change you earlier said could not be done due to lack of time.
Please grant us a brief audience today to explain and submit relevant documents.`
