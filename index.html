      body: `Respected Sir,
We, the aggrieved last attempt candidates of SSC CGL 2025, humbly request you to kindly grant us an urgent meeting regarding the unresolved age reckoning issue.
As you are aware, the DoPT issued a letter on 1 July 2025 recommending that SSC consider revising the age reckoning date to 01.01.2025 for CGL 2025 and Phase 13. However, no action has been taken yet, and with Tier 1 scheduled from 13 August, our entire future hangs in the balance.
Despite our continuous efforts, including filing RTIs and multiple follow-up emails, SSC has not responded to our concerns. We urgently seek a few minutes of your time to present the matter in person before itâ€™s too late.

      body: `Dear Sir,
This is a sincere appeal from last attempt SSC CGL aspirants who are severely impacted by the current age reckoning date of 01.08.2025 in CGL 2025.
We had earlier met you, and you had kindly assured us that SSC would act if DoPT sends a recommendation. DoPT fulfilled that on 1 July, yet the age reckoning remains unchanged. Now, with Tier 1 exam just days away, thousands of aspirants face disqualification.
We request a brief meeting to explain our situation and submit documents in person. Kindly consider our request on urgent humanitarian grounds.

We respectfully seek an urgent meeting before the commencement of SSC CGL 2025 Tier 1 on 13 August. We are last attempt candidates, and despite DoPTâ€™s letter to SSC dated 01.07.2025, the age reckoning date has not been revised to 01.01.2025.
The issue is causing widespread distress among aspirants who prepared for years based on prior SSC patterns. Your intervention is our last hope. We assure you it will only take a few minutes to present our case.

Despite DoPTâ€™s direction on 1 July 2025 and your previous assurance to us, SSC has not revised the reckoning date. With Tier 1 approaching on 13 August, we are being denied our last and rightful attempt.
Please grant us a short meeting to present supporting documents and our appeal in person.
